A professional portfolio website showcasing my **network engineering skills, hands-on lab work, and real-world networking projects**.  
Built with a focus on **clarity, technical depth, and recruiter readability**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio was built to:

- Present my **core networking knowledge** clearly and honestly  
- Demonstrate **hands-on labs and simulations**, not just theory  
- Showcase **real networking projects** with detailed explanations  
- Give recruiters a **quick and accurate understanding** of my skills  

This is not a template or showcase-only project — the site was refined iteratively while learning, testing, breaking, and fixing real implementations.

---

## 👨‍💻 Professional Focus

- Network Engineering fundamentals  
- Routing & Switching concepts  
- Protocol behavior and packet-level understanding  
- Enterprise-style lab simulations  
- Foundational security awareness (network-focused)

Cybersecurity is an **area of growing interest**, built on top of a strong networking foundation — not a replacement for it.
